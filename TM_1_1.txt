You awake in a dense forest, the morning light blurring your vision with it's radiance. 
This is, in itself, nothing new -- you have found youerself in this particular forest, 
your weathered bark and dusty leaves facing this particular sunlight for years now -- 
but something is difrent today. You feel an odd sensation as you come to be aware of 
your surounding, and of yourself -- something you haven't felt before -- or perhaps 
you did -- even thought seems new to you.
