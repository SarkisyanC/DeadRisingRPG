With some hesitation, you try to move, finding you are able to -- your fingers twitch, 
becoming seperated from the coarse oak that they used to be part of. With some dificulty 
you pull yourself free from the wood which used to comprise you, feeling an odd sensation 
of tingling as sensation begings to flood to your new apendages. You feel almost hesitant 
to continue, as the feeling of pins and needles worsens with your every move -- 
yet curiosity burns within you.
