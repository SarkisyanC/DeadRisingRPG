A few adruous moments later, you manage to extricate yourself from the the tree that had been 
your home all these years -- had been you. You fall to your knees before it, legs no longer 
supported by its thick, rigid trunk. the ground feels damp between your knees -- a mark of 
recent rains and good soil. You breifly wonder how your tree will live on without you. 
Such climate and soil will support it for many years, and it will big and strong -- 
I will grow big and strong? You think to yourself, quite confused.
