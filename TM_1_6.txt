You think you recall a vaugue memory -- a feeling of touch upon your bark -- strong but 
delicate fingers. A soft gentle face in the sunlight as you opened your eyes. You wonder if 
this was another being, like yourself and look around, hoping to see them, hoping they can explain.
Alas, no one seems to be about. Slowly you rise from the ground, pulling yourself to your feet. 
You inspect them, wondering at your new form. wiggling your toes -- roots -- you think to yourself --
I have new roots -- roots that can travel?
You take a step forward, wobbly but successfull. Then another. 
This is good? you think to yourself.
