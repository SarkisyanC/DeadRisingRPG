You see a few objects at the base of the tree you emerged from, you can still see your form missing 
from the tree -- a large chunk ripped free and missing. You hope your tree will heal.
You see a large chunk of bark lying at the base, thick and sturdy. A large stone axe with a wooden 
handle lies beside it. Some thick, coarse rope lies beside them.
Thinking they might be usefull, you pick them up and use the rope to secure them to your large frame.
Ready to explore this new world, you set off into the forest.
