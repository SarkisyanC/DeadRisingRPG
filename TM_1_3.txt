Never -- at least not that you can remember -- have you been able to move of your own will. 
Only the wind had sometimes allowed movement to your branches. Though your memory of these 
events seem vaugue -- a mere muscle memory or sensation -- of standing still for years on end 
while the elements raged on around you. 
You can recall the feeling of sunlight warming your leaves, of chilly winter wind freezing 
your exposed bark, of long spring rains quenching your thirst.
